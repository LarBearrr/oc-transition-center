<h4>Bonding is a job placement tool</h4>

<p><strong>Now you can hire and you can be hired because...</strong> The Federal Bonding Program (FBP) provides individual fidelity bonds to employers for job applicants who are (or may be) denied coverage by commercial carriers because of a:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Record of arrest, conviction or imprisonment;</strong></li>
	<li>History of alcohol or drug abuse;</li>
	<li>Poor credit history;</li>
	<li>Lack of an employment history; or</li>
	<li>Dishonorable discharge from military service.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Bonding?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Many employers carry insurance to protect themselves against employee theft or dishonesty. Employees who handle money or valuable tools or goods are covered. This insurance is called fidelity bonding. When such commercial insurance is denied because of an individual’s background, the employer often denies a job to that person. FBP coverage is provided at no cost to the employer or the job applicant.</p>

<p><strong>Processing</strong>... the application procedure is simple and quick. Bonding coverage becomes effective immediately when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The authorized state or local employment security office personnel have certified the bond (the process usually takes one or two days); and</li>
	<li>The applicant has a job offer with a date scheduled to start work or has begun work.</li>
</ul>
