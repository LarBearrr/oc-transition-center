            <h4 class="h4-responsive">How Do Employers Apply?</h4>

            <p>
                If an employer’s new hire is a member of
                one of the target groups, they may apply for
                the tax credit with the Kansas Department
                of Commerce (Commerce).</p>
            <p>
                Commerce will
                provide certification of their eligibility for
                the tax credit.

                on their federal tax return.
