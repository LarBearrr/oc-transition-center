            <p>Wichita Work Release Facility is a minimum custody State work release facility, Kansas Department of Corrections facility which manages convicted felons who have been screened for participation in a community based, residential work release program.</p>
            <p>All of our Participants are considered incarcerated under extended limits of custody.</p>
            <h4 class="h4-responsive">Our Philosopy</h4>
            <p>Work Release strives to provide inmates with an opportunity to gain and maintain full-time employment; save money to be used upon parole release; pay dependent support, if applicable; pay any restitution and court costs owed; and, in general, learn to manage their money and lives under the supervision of employers and facility staff.<p>
            <p>Employers who hire work release participants are, by statute, acting as agents (inmate supervisors) of the Secretary of Corrections [KSA 75-5210(h)].  Therefore, we feel it is important for you to understand the basic work release philosophy and facility rules so that you may better assist the inmate in his/her community re-integration process.</p>
