		<h1><strong>OUR PHILOSOPHY</strong></h1>
		<p class="lead">Work Release strives to provide inmates with an opportunity to gain and maintain full-time employment; save money to be used upon parole release; pay dependent support, if applicable; pay any restitution and court costs owed; and, in general, learn to manage their money and lives under the supervision of employers and facility staff.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="lead">Employers who hire work release participants are, by statute, acting as agents (inmate supervisors) of the Secretary of Corrections [KSA 75-5210(h)].&nbsp; Therefore, we feel it is important for you to understand the basic work release philosophy and facility rules so that you may better assist the inmate in his/her community re-integration process.</p>
