<p style="text-align: center;">All job leads are cross referenced with private databases and are not guarantees of employment. Job leads are simply those that are advertising as hiring. One should never job seek on the basis of/or use these job leads simply as a tool for &ldquo;Employer&rsquo;s that hire Felons&rdquo;. This is counterproductive and alienates employers. It&rsquo;s our strong suggestion that you always job seek on merit of your: Skills, Ability, Experience, Training, Certifications, Interests, and Work History.</p>
