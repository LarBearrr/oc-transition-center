<h1>Welcome to the Transition Center Website!</h1>

<p class="lead">Welcome to the Work Release Program! Wichita Work Release Facility is a residential work release program designed to provide a forum for convicted Felons as the job seeker (seller) to put the tools you have gained in your incarceration to work in securing employment (the buyer). During your time at this facility, counseling and security staff will also work with you towards securing &amp; maintaining employment, budgeting, saving your funds towards a successful release, and finalizing your residence plans prior to your release.</p>

<p class="lead">In addition to “Work Release” as a program in itself, WWRF also provides a variety of support programs to enhance your job seeking experience and support any current sobriety and/or possible post release expectations for treatment. As a corrections professional for the past 18 years, I’m a firm believer that what you apply yourself too while incarcerated will have an impact on how successfully you are overall upon release.</p>

<p class="lead">During your time here at WWRF, there is an expectation as a program participant that you gain and maintain full time employment. Wichita and the surrounding communities as a whole are supportive of our participants as potential employment solutions to the “buyer” market. This is due to a long standing reputation of our offenders for exhibiting responsible work habits, accountability, availability, and as dependable employees. This “Work Readiness” has become the local expectation and should give the motivated job seeker from any offenses, backgrounds, and walks-of-life ample opportunity to take full advantage of their time incarcerated here. Contained within this pamphlet is an overview of substance abuse groups and programs that are available and supporting programs/services for Offender Workforce Development.</p>

<p class="lead">I look forwarding to supporting your job seeking and program related needs. Good luck in your job search!</p>
